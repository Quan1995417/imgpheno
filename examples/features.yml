classes: [Brachypetalum, Cochlopetalum, Paphiopedilum, Parvisepalum]

# Preprocessing steps to perform on images before features are extracted.
preprocess:
    # Limit the maximum dimension for an input image (optional). The input
    # image is scaled down if width or height exceeds the value.
    maximum_dimension: 500

    # Perform segmentation on the image, where the background is removed.
    segmentation:
        # The number of segmentation iterations. Default is 5.
        iterations: 5
        # The margin of the region of interest from the edges of the image.
        # Default is 1.
        margin: 1
